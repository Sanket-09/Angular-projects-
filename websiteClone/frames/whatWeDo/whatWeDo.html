                    The HEAPS platform is a holistic health care management and coordination system that helps all the
                    stakeholders (insurers, hospitals, corporates & patients) improve their care management efficiency,
                    effectiveness and deliverability by leveraging AI-driven data analytics and providing real-time,
                    actionable guidance. This in turn would help every stakeholder extract more value, be it in terms of
                    costs, time and effort invested while reducing the risk of often unwarranted and at times unforeseen
                    circumstances.</p>
